    /**
      Framework objects in an Ember application (components, services, routes, etc.)
      are created via a factory and dependency injection system. Each of these
      objects is the responsibility of an "owner", which handled its
      instantiation and manages its lifetime.
  
      `getOwner` fetches the owner object responsible for an instance. This can
      be used to lookup or resolve other class instances, or register new factories
      into the owner.
  
      For example, this component dynamically looks up a service based on the
      `audioType` passed as an argument:
  
      ```app/components/play-audio.js
      import Component from '@glimmer/component';
      import { action } from '@ember/object';
      import { getOwner } from '@ember/application';
  
      // Usage:
      //
      //   <PlayAudio @audioType={{@model.audioType}} @audioFile={{@model.file}}/>
      //
      export default class extends Component {
        get audioService() {
          let owner = getOwner(this);
          return owner.lookup(`service:${this.args.audioType}`);
        }
  
        @action
        onPlay() {
          let player = this.audioService;
          player.play(this.args.audioFile);
        }
      }
      ```
